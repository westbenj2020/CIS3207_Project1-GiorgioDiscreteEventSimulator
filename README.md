# CIS3207_Project1-GiorgioDiscreteEventSimulator
This project serves to simulate discrete events within an operating system via the utilization of various queue data structures, as well as the modeling of a processor, disks, and network. The system seeks to entertain an arbitrarily large number of jobs (or processes) in a way, such that, no given job may starve from a lack of resource coordination; that is, each componential destination for a job (or process) is optimized in a manner that prevents the occurrence of idle time. This attribute of the system is persistent throughout its lifetime.
